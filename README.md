### apple-leaf-disease-classification-via-vits.py.ipynb
This Jupyter Notebook implements a Vision Transformer-based approach for the classification of apple leaf diseases. It includes the following steps:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Implementation of Vision Transformer (ViT) model
- Training the model on the apple leaf disease dataset
- Evaluation and performance metrics

#### Usage
To run this notebook:
1. Ensure you have all the dependencies installed.
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter.
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
